# plt_analyzer
The python script reads a file containing a list of websites for which the analysis needs to be done. Also reads a file which contains the cache memory limit. The script populates the cache memory limit in the prefs.js file in Mozilla profile folder and analyses the PLT for the cached and uncached version of the websites and generate an analysis for each website detailing the difference in time to load each element in cached and uncached version.
